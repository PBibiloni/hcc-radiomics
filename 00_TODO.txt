# SANITY CHECKS

Visualization for tumor/liver masks: are they correct ??

* Apply separable erosion/dilation for better performance.
* Consider only a bounding box to apply erosion/dilation operations for better performance.
* When dilating from a single pixel, just copy spherical structuring element!


Efficiency:

* Cache pixel_arrays!
